# Concept

If Bob sends a token to Alice on another L2 with zkEVM, a function whereby Alice sends a token to Bob on intmax.
The network with zkEVM functionality is called network 1.
Alice first burns the tokens she wants to send to Bob on intmax.
Alice then records the amount of money she wants to receive from Bob on network 1 via the register() function.
Bob confirms that Alice has correctly burnt the token on intmax and then sends the token that Alice wants through the activate() function.
The intmax network then reflects this information and Bob can receive the tokens Alice has incinerated on intmax.
